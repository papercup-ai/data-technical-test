    "The first section focuses on SQL, and the 2nd section focuses on using python for data analysis and visualization. This notebook includes the questions, and sample code to query the SQLite database. You are free to use any tools to aid you with the solutions and feel free to use a search engine as you go. The entire exercise is expected to take 1-2 hours. \n",
